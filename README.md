This project focuses on analyzing Emergency Room (ER) performance metrics through an interactive Power BI Dashboard.

The goal is to monitor and improve hospital efficiency, patient experience, and operational performance by tracking real-time data such as average wait time, patient satisfaction, admission trends, and demographic insights.

This dashboard enables healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions that enhance service quality, reduce wait time, and improve patient outcomes.

1) The main objectives of this dashboard are to:

2) Analyze the average wait time for patients in the emergency department.

3) Measure patient satisfaction scores to evaluate quality of service.

4) Track the number of patients admitted, discharged, or under treatment.
